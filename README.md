Software Control Management is a process of managing changes to software overtime with the following goals:
- Ensure Software Integrity
- Maintain Tracebility
- Maintain Reliability
- Maintain Consistency

SCM is done through multiple means, typically involving a repository like Github
1) Version Control: Used to track changes to source code by specific users and easily roleback to previous versions if necessary
2) Change Management: A Managment system for teams where every change commited to the repo is reviewed before applying to the main branch
3) Build Management: Automation of compilation of code, ensuring that each build is consistent.
